# Object Oriented Design
This is my (Aris Yu's) Java portfolio for the course CSCI328 - Object Oriented Design at MCLA, taught by Mark Cohen. I'm taking this course in the spring semester of 2022. Associated programs are in individual folders labeled by number and project type. 
### Assignments
* Assignment 1 (02/04/22): Setting up Replit and Git integration. Basic shell usage.
* Assignment 2 (02/11/22): Modification of Course for practice with ArrayLists and simple methods. Creation of Jug for practice with classes.
* Assignment 3 (02/18/22): Creation of Chia, an extremely basic model of a Chia pet, as further class practice.
* Assignment 4 (03/04/22): Working with interfaces, creating three simple implementations of IElectricBill. Introduction to static variables in classes.
* Assignment 5 (03/11/22, submitted 04/01/22): Use of inheritance and the extends keyword with Top2Grader (extending Grader) and SmartMove (extending NextMove).
* Assignment 6 (04/01/22): Introduction to the Singleton design pattern in SkiConstants and StackQueueSingleton. Review of the stack and queue data structures.
* Assignment 7 (04/08/22): Introduction to abstract classes and the Strategy design pattern, creating two grader strategies and three filters. Use of interfaces and abstract classes in tandem. Basic use of comparators with KidZone.
### Practice
* Practice 1 (02/23/22): Implementation of Car and Wheel according to given specifications.
* Practice 2 (03/23/22, submitted 04/01/22): Creation of the interface IEstimatable, its implementation House, and a class extending that implementation SolidConstructionHouse according to given specifications.
* Practice 3 (04/20/22): Practice with the Strategy design pattern with MixMaker and Simple, two subclasses of (a provided class) AbstractCombine. 
### Exams
* Exam 1 (02/25/22): Creation of Customer, Item, and Order to work with a provided Main file according to a UML diagram.
* Exam 2 (03/25/22): Creation of the interface IAnalyzer. Implementation in Validator, RunChanges, and DominantRunChar to analyze strings consisting of + and - characters. Use of the *implements* and *extends* keywords.
* Exam 3 (04/22/22): Creation of three strategies for nucleotide comparison: CountAlg, an implementation of the provided interface IDiffAlg, and OrderAlg/WeightedOrderAlg, subclasses of the provided class AbstractOrderAlg (itself an implementation of IDiffAlg). All three classes used the Singleton and Strategy design patterns.
